# Software Developer Test

## Assignment

The application consists of a front end and the REST services that support it. This exercise is to create a simple web application based on the following scenario. 

# Scenario
Your goal is to create a web application that allows users to schedule a meeting between Mentor and Mentee and present the resulting list of meetings in a tabular format.

```User story: As a user, I want to pair a mentor with one mentee and schedule one or more meetings for this specific match ```

Definitions: 

Mentor is a person with the following atributes: Name, emai, title, company, years of experience, area of expertise

Mentee is a person with the following atributes: Name, email, title, company, years of experience, area of expertise

Meeting: a planned session when mentor and mentee come virtually together with the following atributes : date, hour and meeting url, 

Match: a pair between mentor and mentee



# Deliverables for this exercise:

* Create a model schema for what is needed in the database in order to support this feature. This can be in just JSON or comments. You do not need to spend time setting up databases.

* Write out all of the REST endpoints needed to support the building of this page. This can be delivered simply as comments.

* Implement at least one of the REST endpoints with preferably Node/Express and Typescript, but you can choose to use the language you are most comfortable with. This can return mock JSON.

* Front-end: Implement at leas one React components. Write how you would break down the implementation of the front-end components.
